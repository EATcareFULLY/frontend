## Service worker:
### What is it?
It stores the data from the frontend and backend provider.
### What data should be in it?
html, css, images, cached fetch responses.
### Where can I find it?
Firefox:
`Inspect -> Data -> Local storage -> Link -> my-pwa-cache1`
Chrome: 
`Inspect -> Application -> Cache storage -> my-pwa-cache1`
# Possible errors
## Page is reloading infinitely
Go to your browser settings and clear storage for a whole website.
Probably service worker registered itself twice
## I see the old version of application 
It can happen that old data from service worker overrides the port that you want to use.
You just need to delete my-pwa-cache1.
`Service worker occupies url so it may save your different project which was hosted using this url.` 
## Some pages are on infinite loading
Redirect doesn't seem to work currently so page is blocked on loading screen
## keycloak true error
After no activity for a long time, error occurs stating 'true' caused by keycloak.
